# Content Dependency Injection (CDI)

Small sample Code to learn CDI functionality. This code covers the CDI Themes like:

* Injection  
* Lazy Injection  
* Qualifier  
* Producer  
* Interceeptor  
* Event Observer  
* Decorator  
* Stereotype  

`cdi` project contains cdi classes that will be packed in jar file and used by `cdi-client` project.

Build both projects by running`./gradlew clean build` on both of them and deploy the created war file in `cdi-client` project and click on each Link in `index.html` page. The Links on that page represent the CDI Themes.

Enjoy it !
